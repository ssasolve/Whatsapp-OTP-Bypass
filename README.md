WhatsApp is a popular app with an easy-to-use interface that allows people to quickly share text and voice messages as well as other types of data such as photos, music, and videos. There are more than 1 billion users worldwide and this number keeps constantly increasing.

However, even though it is all this simple and convenient, it also has some disadvantages. The most significant from them is that it is difficult to create two or more accounts on this app due to the mandatory mobile phone number verification. Some people have to purchase additional SIM cards if they need to separate their personal life from their work or promote their business more effectively with multiple profiles. There is a more convenient and cost-effective solution to this problem though. Just use a fake phone number for verification on WhatsApp.
